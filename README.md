## Description

_The Massah webstore runs with a lot of help from Angular2 and a big assist from Firebase for secure data storage.  Users are able to seemlessly navigate our store and checkout with ease and peace of mind.  They can connect with our fabulous social media pages, save items to their cart, and find links to sales, new collections, and interesting articles._

#### Here are a few images from our beautiful site.

## Workflow

#### Trello Digital Stickies & Whiteboarding

Our process began with a roundtable discussion captured on the the Trello Board.  We talked components/models/pipes/services and user stories.

###### Here's that board in action.

We moved on to whiteboarding the layout of our components and pages, which in turn, set us on a path to understand our routing and foresee many of the chokepoints of our work.
